# Data Engineering Portfolio â€” General ETL (with Airflow)

This portfolio showcases multiple small, production-style ETL pipelines with a shared utils module, an Airflow DAG to orchestrate them, and a warehouse schema + analytics SQL. It runs out-of-the-box on SQLite and supports PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL`.
